"Hi {{Name}}, We help start-ups and established companies like {{Company}} acquire a unique and compelling brand image that will represent {{Company}} in the market place. In the first week, we take in all the information you have that will guide us in achieving the desired image. That includes: existing mock-ups, user stories, interaction flows, previous design work, and designs, samples, or brands that you like. This is followed by a phone coversation to discuss how you envision your story being told. Then, we will create initial design mock-ups for your review. By discussing these mock-ups, we will have a better idea of the brand image you want. We will repeat the process of design, review, and discussion until we achieve the look and feel that you love. After this, we will use the finalized design as a baseline to tell the rest of the story, in the UIUX, in the design of the products, and in the overall customer-facing, company presence. The end results will be the brand image that {{Company}} will be proud to display and which will communicate the propoer tone not only to the targeted market segment but also to the world at large.

"Hi Kalyna,
 
Please find below the proposal for the LiveLeads by Punch. We would love to get the ball rolling here as it will allow us to explore many other opportunities.
 
{{Link}}
 
We would love to jump on a quick call to walk you through it and answer any questions you may have. Are you available later this week for a quick call?
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
 
—--------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
Thanks for this I’ll have a look.
 
I’d love your take on the app as well.
 
Can you send the separate proposal for that?
 
Much appreciated,
Kalyna 
 
—---------------------
 
Hi Kalyna,
 
I would love to put together a proposal if I will have any details on the scope of work. It will allow us to share some team details, timelines, and cost estimates.
 
I can put together a quick document on the pricing and what you can expect from the team on Design and Development.
 
Let me know what you think and I can keep it moving forward here.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
 
—---------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
A proposal ASAP before end of week would be very useful with a timeline (week over week) estimated delivery, cost and such so we can go to investors and be sure to get moving into development.
 
There is a current async ML component. We are not married to the idea of having to tie all of those models in real time to Zoom. However, they do need to show up in a meaningful way on the client’s dashboard at some point.
 
Most immediately, if we can get something showing people real time insights in meetings, we are WELL on our way to the next stage of our MVP.
 
Here is an example product: 
 
This is another one (although they built their own video meeting area, we do NOT want to do that but rather plug in as Equalicert has.):
 
 
We do NOT want to be a DEI product but a performance improvement, management, leadership, professional development product.
 
 
Here’s an overview:
 
 
This is the general UX idea.
 
- React/Node
- Python Tensorflow for the AWS ML Models
- We have NLP, and use Audio, Video and the Chat to analyze Emotions (audio) Video (eye movements for engagement) but we are not set on all of our models being integrated right now depending on what's fastest/easiest/possible to integrate to talk in real time with a zoom meeting.
 
Ideally we want:
- Interruption notifications (If someone is interrupting a lot, they get a ping)
- Speaking time (depending on context - so we have 8 different use cases roughly, if someone is monopolizing the conversation based on the context of the call, they get pinged. We will provide the % speaking time intervals for you)
- Emotions (help the meeting leader and individual participants understand how they sound. Is there voice coming across as stressed? anxious? Are they speaking faster than normal? We want to let them know.)*** This will set us apart if you can do this in real time by hooking up to the audio of the meeting and running it through our ML model during the meeting time and sending that information back to the Zoom user in a panel.
 
If we had those three prompts (integrating the machine learning models or not) this would be a HUGE win.
 
Core Deliverables:
- We need a Zoom marketplace approval for the app so users can download it using the marketplace: (we are not set on Zoom but it is preferrable. We need to start somewhere and ultimately will need to move to Teams, Meet capabilities so whatever direction we start in is fine.)
- Paywall for users to be able to pay in order to use the service, usage based, 10 hours meetings free then a price per hour, not determined yet.
In AWS our own app on where users can log in and see their meeting history results
- Admin dashboards (in the mockups) for an administrator of a company (group individual users into the company, also for managers of teams or teachers of a class for example who might need access to aggregated statistics based on groups of individuals in their organization) and
- Individual user dashboard (individual meeting stats that are collected)
 
Our current ML models can already use recordings to analyze videos so we need to hook those up to the dashboard. We have a terrible dashboard on bubble that we need to migrate over essentially. We use integromat to automate sequences.
 
I’ve got this to our devs, but I think I am missing some “tech” vocabulary and direction on this. 
 
Please let me know.
 
Thanks!
  
Kalyna

Hi Kalyna,
 
We will start working on this first thing tomorrow and I will reach out to you if there will be any questions from the team.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
—--------------------
 
Great – as for the other pitch, I’m seeing $1,000/month for two individuals to run email campaigns?
 
Are they doing appointment setting?
 
As mentioned on that end I was looking for a guaranteed result of some sort before paying for further BD/Sales help.
 
Thanks,
Kalyna
—--------------------
 
Hi Kalyna,
 
My apologies for taking longer than expected to get back to you but there were a few thorough details our team had to go through.
 
Please find below the link for the proposal.
{{Link}}
 
Happy to jump on a quick call to answer any questions. Afternoons work best for us.
 
For the email marketing campaigns, our original proposal was only revolving around LeadGen but we can surely offer you more for less as the referrals are our key interest here. We are right working on scaling our technology right now and are only a few weeks away. Please read about it here: 
{{Link}} (draft version)
 
Feel free to share any thoughts.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
 
—--------------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
Thanks for this.
 
This quote is way out of budget for an MVP. How can you reduce this? I especially think 8 weeks for UX is extreme given our current wireframes already in existence, Zoom’s UI to leverage in app and the simplicity of what dashboard we’re asking for users to have access to meeting data.
 
If we were to simplify this MVP even further, what’s the cheapest you can go on a Zoom Marketplace app, integrating some basics like Equalicert has?
Would it be easier on Google as an extension like they have done?
 
I would love a few different options please.
 
Also, in your figmatic link, your videos are unaligned to the laptop screens.
 
I’ve attached an image for your reference.
 
If you can do something on the lead gen side, let me know. I’d love a trial or something along with the promise of sending you referrals upon success. I think this in combination with the MVP development would be a sweetspot for us.
 
Thanks!
 
Warmly,
Kalyna

"Hi {{Name}}, The boilerplate package includes:

1. Consultation to understand your business and create the campaign including:
     A. Problem-solution pairs
     B. Reframing (If you sell boats, don't sell the boat, sell time on the water)
     C. Drafting invitations to do business (copy that would go into campaigns)
     D. Anticipating objections and writing objections handling collateral
 2. Design (this is an add-on option)
     A. Creating embedded images that can be used to call attention to e-mail campaigns
     B. Designing the templates for use with the marketing and objection handling collateral

After the above 2 steps are done then we will have the ability to continue with...

1. Campaign setup
      A. Organizing the campaign/campaigns into a sequence of steps (e-mail, social, phone)
      B. Tracking progress across campaigns and sales reps (open rates, click-through rates, response rates, appointment rates, proposal rates, closing rates)
      C. Continual process of renewal (revisiting campaigns that are and are not performing well, new idea generation for new invitations to do business).
2. Lead sourcing
       A. Identifying lead sources
       B. Combination of manual and automatic scraping to gather leads and find contacts at those companies
3. Launch
       A. Combining the campaign with the lead sourcing to implement the campaign, contact leads, and monitor metrics

This package is our most basic package and includes several sales reps, a sales manager, the software we use to run the campaign, and myself or one of our other senior staff to draft the invitations to do business and campaign objection handling strategy.

I hope that helps answer your question. We'd like the opportunity to work together, but we don't have much room for the price.

Our most basic package runs ~ $5k per month for the above-mentioned with a minimum commitment of 3 months.

I'm not sure where we could remove/cut while having the campaign still be effective.

For example, if we don't spend the proper time creating the campaign and move to contact customers, we will not get a good response rate. On the other hand, if we don't have the sales support to contact customers we will not do the required numbers to get appointments and ultimately won business

—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.
