"{{Name}}, 
 
I'm happy we have the call scheduled next week to showcase our marketing tech. In the meantime, looping in {{Name}} to send over UI/UX and graphic work samples.
 
Sherry, some of the {{Project}} and {{Project}} work would be good, maybe {{Project}} and anything else you see fit.
 
Also {{Name}} the team has added you to the Spamfix calls now.
 
Looking forward,

Hi {{Name}},
 
We take an agile approach incorporating metrics and A-B testing into our approach, including customer retention, average order size, and cart abandonment KPIs to decrease cart abandonment against the control group.
 
I am sharing some of their case studies below:
 
{{Name}} mentioned your interest in the lookbook and that would a great opportunity for us to impress you with our design skills and capabilities. I have attached below a couple of iterations of the lookbook we did years ago and but our work for you would include a lot of innovation and brand new techniques to provide a better experience to the users.
 
Let me know about your availability next week and we would love to hear your thoughts about how you would like to proceed with it.
 
I will share the invites once you confirm.
 
Thanks,
—----------------------
 
Hi {{Name}},
 
Did you get a chance to review these samples?   
 
Our in-depth experience has helped us execute numerous e-commerce projects and our metric reviews are driven by user experience analysis, A-B testing, and strategic positioning to create a comprehensive strategy around growth and retention to increase top-line revenue. I can also connect you with a few of our clients and you can see for yourself why they think so highly of us.
 
We would love to jump on a quick call to learn about your ideas and expectations, we’ll put together a detailed proposal to cover all of your requirements. We can then jump on a call and review the proposal together and then go for the project kickoff.
 
Do you have any availability today in the afternoon or early next week?
 
Thanks,

Please let me know what time and day works the best for you so we can schedule the meeting and have a chat,1
"Hi {{Name}},
 
I found your company on Indeed and wanted to discuss how our ShadowProgram could help ITX Corp increase engineering productivity 2x in a 30-day pilot.
 
Our ShadowProgram pairs our ex-Google verified team of full-stack, back-end, and/or mobile engineers with your engineering team to double current engineering velocity; each of your engineer's ""Shadow"" will enable a 2-fold increase in storyboard tracker points delivered per sprint after the ShadowProgram is initiated within 30-days.
 
We've executed projects for Airware, Cape, PocketGems, Marie Kondo, The League, and over 70+ other companies and startups successfully with our ShadowProgram.
 
Our ShadowProgram often works in one of two ways –
 
1-to-1: Our engineers pair up 1-to-1 with your engineers, so each engineer on your team has a Punch Shadow that's doubling output, your engineer's ""Shadow"" is often working on the same feature or deliverable
 
Team-to-team: We split responsibilities by team, where we take certain features or milestones as well as your team members, and double overall output, often splitting up segments of work
 
I'd like to set up a call to discuss a 30-day pilot of our Shadow program with you, how does your calendar look this week and we can set up a time?
 
—-----------------------
Just a quick follow-up from my previous email about {{Our Company}} and how you can benefit from our services. 
 
I would love to have a conversation with you and discuss how {{Our Company}} can add value to {{Company_Name}}. Do you happen to be available anytime this week for a quick meet & greet call?
 
—-------------------
Thanks for reaching out. I may have some availability {{Day}} of next week, in the morning {{Timezone}}.
Please let me know if any time between {{Time}}  {{timezone}} and noon {{Timezone}} works for you.

Thanks,
—-------------------
 
Thanks for sending the information.
Apologies, I had a long day of work on Friday and by the end of the day, I had forgotten about sending you the MSA.
Here is the MSA model, the SoW model, and the Contractor Agreement (that the individual contractors would need to sign to be notified of the expectations around non-compete, confidentiality, etc).
—-----------------------
 
Thank you for sending these over. I'll send you the signed copy shortly. 
 
Can you please specify this (screenshot below) as this is a bit confusing
—----------------------
 
As I think we are moving towards an agency contractor ship agreement the above-mentioned screenshot would not be required for us to fill.
 
Thanks,
—-------------------
 
Please find attached the signed copies of the MSA's from our side. We will keep the contractor agreement and get that signed when we start the augmentation process.
 
What does your calendar look like for Thursday or Friday this week to discuss further and start the augmentation process? 
 
Thanks,
—-----------------
 
{{Name}}
Sorry, I cannot see the screenshot you mention.
What I can provide as context, is that we use the same MSA for all types of engagements (C2C, C2H, and Direct Hire). That's why it has the provision of a ""hiring fee"" or a ""conversion fee"". 
It is the SoW that defines what is the engagement type, and in the case of agencies like yours, we would simply do a C2C, with no conversion clause. 
Hope that helps build the right context.
If you are in agreement with the MSA (understanding that it includes some clauses that will not be invoked) I can have our legal counsel send you a link for an electronic signature (with HelloSign).
—-------------------------
 
{{Name}}
Our Legal Counsel sent it on 11/04. And just re-sent e-signature through HelloSign

Got it now! It missed my Inbox. I have signed it from our side.
 
When are you available to discuss the next steps?

—------------------------
 
Hi {{Name}}!
 
It was great to meet you too. 
 
The person you mention, for what position would it be? So we can schedule it.
 
I share the most critical positions that we need to cover:
 
Sr Frontend Developer: {{Link}}
Sr Backend Developer: {{Link}}
System Administrator: {{Link}}
DevOps Engineer: {{Link}}
 
It is mandatory for all positions that candidates have a fluent level of English. Especially for the DevOps position, this point is totally defining since it will have direct contact with the client.
In addition to fluency, we consider that communication skills, in general, are a key point, and so the ability of multi-location and multi-cultural teamwork.
 
Another important point is the possibility of working in the client's time: {{Time}} and for DevOps and SysAdmin the person should be able to cover on-call rotations.
 
If you need any other additional information, do not hesitate to reach out.
 
Thank you!
 
Greetings.

"Hi Adam,
 
We have put together a quick proposal to get the current model further trained.
 
{{Company_Name}} Proposal - (NLP Model Retraining):
 
I will share a copy of the new Exhibit for the Services Agreement with you today via DocuSign.
 
Our team is currently working on a demo about video personalization over scaleable email marketing campaigns. I wanted to learn about your availability for Friday or early next week for that. 
 
I will share the invites for the demo once you confirm. We are pretty excited to learn your thoughts on it.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
—----------------------
 
Thanks Sherry
 
Regarding the data format, is approved client content that covers a new topic the model hasn't been trained on yet but that doesn't have any search queries associated to it still usable for training purposes?
 
Adam
 
—---------------------
 
Hi Adam,
 
It would be helpful to have at least one query associated with the content, also we can normalize the data with the previous data we have by adding in data labeling for $1,500 one-time cost.
 
Thanks,
Sherry
—------------------------
Thanks Sherry
 
We'll make sure there's at least 1 query per piece then, hopefully more.
 
Just to confirm the quote includes doing any necessary clean-up on the copy right? Last time you guys did stuff like stripping out HTML before training.
 
Adam
—-----------------------
Hi Adam,
 
Yes, that’s included as it helps us achieve optimal results.
 
If that sounds good, I will send a copy of the exhibit your way via DocuSign today.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
—---------------------
 
Go for it 
 
—------------------
Hi Adam,
 
I have put together a copy of the exhibit and shared it with you via DocuSign. I have attached a copy here for your review here as well.
 
In terms of API requests cost, we will share the monthly cost with you prior to the invoice. 
 
Feel free to reach out with any questions.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
—-----------------------
 
Hi Sherry
 
Thanks for this, I am still waiting for sign off on this but will review as and when we get there.
 
Regarding the API costs, do you mean for the old project, this project or both projects? In either case I need a bit more than advance notice of an invoice coming in.  I need a clear means of reporting so I can see usage and predict future costs. I'll take your suggestion but if you have no specific format in mind I would personally recommend a shared spreadsheet that you can keep updated with two tables (one per project), entering details of payments and usage as in the example attached - would this work for you? If so I can upload to our sharepoint and share with you.
 
Adam
—----------------------
 
Hi Adam,
 
The format works great for us. We can use this format for reporting the API cost and usage every month and you will be notified every time we update the sheet.
 
You can view the sheet here:
 
{{Link}}
 
We can also do this over your Sharepoint if you want but I will ensure that you will have crystal visibility before any invoice is generated.
 
Many thanks,
 
Sherry

As per our last call, we pre-processed the data you sent us which includes measures like removing Chinese from blog data,
and removing HTML tags for model adaptation & training. If needed or requested by you, we can provide the pre-processed script or
data to you.
We were able to train the model to generate pretty good blogs as per your requirements and have been able to meet the criteria
discussed last week, which are;
1. HTML Generated output (similar to the data you sent to us. We pre-processed it for fine-tuning and training and now can
deliver an output embedded with HTML tags as per your requirement.)
2. Links embedded; the blog data that is generated will now be populated with respective links from the data that was sent over.
I'm attaching the API in the email attachment, please test it and send in any or all feedback you have for us.
We can either generate the data programmatically in any format (CSV HTML, etc) or you can use the API and generate it. Let
us know what you prefer.

—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.

"Hi Kalyna,
 
Please find below the proposal for the LiveLeads by Punch. We would love to get the ball rolling here as it will allow us to explore many other opportunities.

We would love to jump on a quick call to walk you through it and answer any questions you may have. Are you available later this week for a quick call?
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry

Hey Sherry,
 
Thanks for this I’ll have a look.
 
I’d love your take on the app as well.
 
Can you send the separate proposal for that?
 
Much appreciated,
Kalyna 
 
—---------------------
 
Hi Kalyna,
 
I would love to put together a proposal if I will have any details on the scope of work. It will allow us to share some team details, timelines, and cost estimates.
 
I can put together a quick document on the pricing and what you can expect from the team on Design and Development.
 
Let me know what you think and I can keep it moving forward here.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
 
—---------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
A proposal ASAP before end of week would be very useful with a timeline (week over week) estimated delivery, cost and such so we can go to investors and be sure to get moving into development.
 
There is a current async ML component. We are not married to the idea of having to tie all of those models in real time to Zoom. However, they do need to show up in a meaningful way on the client’s dashboard at some point.
 
Most immediately, if we can get something showing people real time insights in meetings, we are WELL on our way to the next stage of our MVP.
 
Here is an example product: 
 
This is another one (although they built their own video meeting area, we do NOT want to do that but rather plug in as Equalicert has.):
 
 
We do NOT want to be a DEI product but a performance improvement, management, leadership, professional development product.
 
 
Here’s an overview:
 
 
This is the general UX idea.
 
- React/Node
- Python Tensorflow for the AWS ML Models
- We have NLP, and use Audio, Video and the Chat to analyze Emotions (audio) Video (eye movements for engagement) but we are not set on all of our models being integrated right now depending on what's fastest/easiest/possible to integrate to talk in real time with a zoom meeting.
 
Ideally we want:
- Interruption notifications (If someone is interrupting a lot, they get a ping)
- Speaking time (depending on context - so we have 8 different use cases roughly, if someone is monopolizing the conversation based on the context of the call, they get pinged. We will provide the % speaking time intervals for you)
- Emotions (help the meeting leader and individual participants understand how they sound. Is there voice coming across as stressed? anxious? Are they speaking faster than normal? We want to let them know.)*** This will set us apart if you can do this in real time by hooking up to the audio of the meeting and running it through our ML model during the meeting time and sending that information back to the Zoom user in a panel.
 
If we had those three prompts (integrating the machine learning models or not) this would be a HUGE win.
 
Core Deliverables:
- We need a Zoom marketplace approval for the app so users can download it using the marketplace: (we are not set on Zoom but it is preferrable. We need to start somewhere and ultimately will need to move to Teams, Meet capabilities so whatever direction we start in is fine.)
- Paywall for users to be able to pay in order to use the service, usage based, 10 hours meetings free then a price per hour, not determined yet.
In AWS our own app on where users can log in and see their meeting history results
- Admin dashboards (in the mockups) for an administrator of a company (group individual users into the company, also for managers of teams or teachers of a class for example who might need access to aggregated statistics based on groups of individuals in their organization) and
- Individual user dashboard (individual meeting stats that are collected)
 
Our current ML models can already use recordings to analyze videos so we need to hook those up to the dashboard. We have a terrible dashboard on bubble that we need to migrate over essentially. We use integromat to automate sequences.
 
I’ve got this to our devs, but I think I am missing some “tech” vocabulary and direction on this. 
 
Please let me know.
 
Thanks!
  
Kalyna
—--------------------
 
Hi Kalyna,
 
We will start working on this first thing tomorrow and I will reach out to you if there will be any questions from the team.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry

Great – as for the other pitch, I’m seeing $1,000/month for two individuals to run email campaigns?
 
Are they doing appointment setting?
 
As mentioned on that end I was looking for a guaranteed result of some sort before paying for further BD/Sales help.

Happy to jump on a quick call to answer any questions. Afternoons work best for us.
 
For the email marketing campaigns, our original proposal was only revolving around LeadGen but we can surely offer you more for less as the referrals are our key interest here. We are right working on scaling our technology right now and are only a few weeks away. Please read about it here:

Feel free to share any thoughts.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
 
—--------------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
Thanks for this.
 
This quote is way out of budget for an MVP. How can you reduce this? I especially think 8 weeks for UX is extreme given our current wireframes already in existence, Zoom’s UI to leverage in app and the simplicity of what dashboard we’re asking for users to have access to meeting data.
 
If we were to simplify this MVP even further, what’s the cheapest you can go on a Zoom Marketplace app, integrating some basics like Equalicert has?
Would it be easier on Google as an extension like they have done?
 
I would love a few different options please.

Regarding the data format, is approved client content that covers a new topic the model hasn't been trained on yet but that doesn't have any search queries associated to it still usable for training purposes?

Hi Adam,
 
It would be helpful to have at least one query associated with the content, also we can normalize the data with the previous data we have by adding in data labeling for $1,500 one-time cost.

Thanks Sherry
 
We'll make sure there's at least 1 query per piece then, hopefully more.
 
Just to confirm the quote includes doing any necessary clean-up on the copy right? Last time you guys did stuff like stripping out HTML before training.

Feel free to reach out with any questions.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
—-----------------------
 
Hi Sherry
 
Thanks for this, I am still waiting for sign off on this but will review as and when we get there.
 
Regarding the API costs, do you mean for the old project, this project or both projects? In either case I need a bit more than advance notice of an invoice coming in.  I need a clear means of reporting so I can see usage and predict future costs. I'll take your suggestion but if you have no specific format in mind I would personally recommend a shared spreadsheet that you can keep updated with two tables (one per project), entering details of payments and usage as in the example attached - would this work for you? If so I can upload to our sharepoint and share with you.
 
Adam
—----------------------
 
Hi Adam,
 
The format works great for us. We can use this format for reporting the API cost and usage every month and you will be notified every time we update the sheet.
 
You can view the sheet here:
 
{{Link}}
 
We can also do this over your Sharepoint if you want but I will ensure that you will have crystal visibility before any invoice is generated.
 
Many thanks,

"Hi [Name], I was going through your website and saw that you guys were looking for Business Development folks in New York and Chicago regions. I thought our B2B Growth program would sound interesting to you. Our B2B program in a nutshell: We will pull across 10,000 different sites through manual and automated research to arrive at 50 to 100 LiveLeads every day of prospects in the market for your services, then our outreach team will contact these prospects with A-B testing 4 to 5 various pitches, set appointments from your domain, and follow up with your collateral, with the goal of closing setting 20 appointments by the end of month 2, starting from no existing pipeline. I have also attached a PDF document highlighting savings from B2B Program. If this interests you, give me a shout out and we can set up a call. Many thanks, {{Sender_name}}

"The meeting was held this morning with the same end result which is ‘hold’; primarily because one customer's implementation schedule was pushed out a quarter due to them having infra challenges.  This buys us a little breathing room but I am impressed with them it is only a short stay and we need to address this both in the intermediate-term and how it can be an option for any future… bottlenecks.

First my apologies for a long time between communications. We've been more than just busy and as with most projects, everything takes longer than expected.
 
In terms of our last conversation, I was able to reduce the number of pages to ~250 far less than the initial  800 and many of the pages still have a number of images ( in full size)  present. I kept the images as they are linked. with some more work, it could reduce the overall page count to ~200 or less......
 
Let me know your updated thoughts and let's continue our interaction as the other aspect of our project, web scraping using python with the appropriate returns is still in play and this database would get that off the ground effectively.

I will follow up on {{Day}} again if I would not hear from you by then.

As promised the updated SOW. 
 
I trust that this will clarify our engagement a bit more deeply than the minimal statement in the last proposal you sent.

Also want to follow up on a referral agreement...

Hi {{Name}},
 
Happy {{Day}} and thank you for putting these details together. I have already shared it with our team and they might come up with some questions today or tomorrow.
 
In the meantime, we will start working on putting together a quick proposal and aim to share it by {{Day}}/{{Day}} this week.

Hi {{Name}},

They seem to be missing and was wondering if you can share those with us.
 
Thanks,

Your previous data result ( Demo GUF data below)  and the fields are on track overall, the only real difference would be the deeper levels of descriptions for both the funding: ie.  timing of the offerings (rolling or deadlines) using our descriptors of their industries  (Industries column) for more granularity, ie: fintech then to hardware/service/software as an example.  Our schema has industries broken into subsets. Obviously, only available data for these subsets will be added to the final and ongoing database.   Does this assist in clarification?
 
 
I'm reviewing the referral agreement and will have some feedback next week.

Hi {{Name}},
 
This clarifies a lot of details and we can definitely share the proposal now before the day ends tomorrow.

"Hi {{Name}}, Thanks for reaching out. To launch and maintain these campaigns is an enormous amount of work. We need to spend the time to...
 
1. Understand your business
2. Think creatively about how to reach customers (invitations to do business derived from problem-solution pairs).
3. Identify creative ways to find leads.
4. Create the campaigns in a way where we have a 360-degree view of the customer (Social, email, phone, chat)
5. Work the pipeline and stay engaged while we help build a relationship with the prospect
6. Ultimately move them along to a close.
 
In addition to the above steps, we have to work with clients on upgrading their collateral and website because those pieces dictate the extent to which we can support them.
 
I understand that you would like to move forward however we cannot do this work without being paid for it. I understand that you want a results-driven team, however, our outreach projects are structured with both components:
 
A.) A monthly stipend to pay the bills and all the above creative work.
B.) A contingency commission that is paid to the sales rep for them to stay motivated.
 
I think you will have a hard time finding a quality team that will execute what you want strictly on a contingency basis.
 
If things change feel free to reach out.

I completely understand your concern regarding the timelines and cost estimates that we have proposed for this project. As far as the proportionality of pricing to the efficiency and quality of work are related, Punch’s expertise will never be questioned from your side, we make sure we deliver within the timelines that have been put forward by our team.
 
Also, as we had a brief intro, I would suggest a detailed discussion of your necessities and extent of work in our next call and that will allow me to revise the cost and timelines more accurately, taking into account the current needs of {{Company}}.

"Hello Simon,
 
I found you on Indeed looking for a Data & Examinations Assistant and wanted to reach out to discuss how we can help with Bridlington School's artificial intelligence/machine learning strategy.
 
We’re an ex-Google-founded engineering team specializing in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) implementations. We’ve worked on both supervised and unsupervised strategies, classification, time-series, quant/financial, and reinforcement learning problems.
 
Our general approach to ML / AI involves identifying direct and alternative data streams, causality, correlation, and importance testing, data normalization, model strategy development and tuning, hyperparameter optimization, and F-1 score tuning through meta-labeling.
 
We’ve worked with Cape, Dispatchr, 1-Page, Google, and many other companies requiring AI and ML.
 
I’d like to set up a time to discuss how Punch can help Bridlington School’s AI/ML needs.
 
Can we discuss it later this afternoon?

"{{Name}},
 
First my apologies for a long time between communications. We've been more than just busy and as with most projects, everything takes longer than expected.
 
In terms of our last conversation, I was able to reduce the number of pages to ~250 far less than the initial  800 and many of the pages still have a number of images ( in full size)  present. I kept the images as they are linked. with some more work, it could reduce the overall page count to ~200 or less......
 
Let me know your updated thoughts and let's continue our interaction as the other aspect of our project, web scraping using python with the appropriate returns is still in play and this database would get that off the ground effectively.
 
Best,

{{Name}},
 
{{Name}} and I together with our programmers will be spending some additional time defining the scope of work update we spoke of last week. We will be deploying the SOW to your firm next week. 
 
I apologize for the delay however, it's better for both our firms to have the granularity needed to ensure a great outcome.  
 
Not certain if I missed the referral agreement we discussed?
 
Will be in touch next week, with updated details.
 
Best,

Hi {{Name}},
 
That sounds like a plan. We can jump on a quick call as soon as you will share something with us.
 
In terms of the next steps. we would love to put together a quick proposal outlining the cost and the estimates there.
 
I will follow up on {{Day}} again if I would not hear from you by then.
 
Thanks,
—--------------
 
{{Name}},
 
As promised the updated SOW. 
 
I trust that this will clarify our engagement a bit more deeply than the minimal statement in the last proposal you sent.
 
Any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
 
Also want to follow up on a referral agreement...
 
Best,

Hi {{Name}},
 
Happy {{Day}} and thank you for putting these details together. I have already shared it with our team and they might come up with some questions today or tomorrow.
 
In the meantime, we will start working on putting together a quick proposal and aim to share it by {{Day}}/{{Day}} this week.
 
Do you have any availability for a quick call this{{Day}}/{{Day}}? The afternoons work best for us.
 
Thanks,

Will coordinate with {{Name}}  and let you know later today regarding the best times for our next conversation.....and the referral agreement?

Hi {{Name}},
 
The team just went through the scope and wanted to ask about the mind map and any excel sample sheet which is mentioned in the document.
 
They seem to be missing and was wondering if you can share those with us.
 
Thanks,
—--------------
{{Name}},
 
Your previous data result ( Demo GUF data below)  and the fields are on track overall, the only real difference would be the deeper levels of descriptions for both the funding: ie.  timing of the offerings (rolling or deadlines) using our descriptors of their industries  (Industries column) for more granularity, ie: fintech then to hardware/service/software as an example.  Our schema has industries broken into subsets. Obviously, only available data for these subsets will be added to the final and ongoing database.   Does this assist in clarification?
 
 
I'm reviewing the referral agreement and will have some feedback next week.
 
Best
 
—--------------------
 
Hi {{Name}},
 
This clarifies a lot of details and we can definitely share the proposal now before the day ends tomorrow.

"Hi {{Name}},
 
I found your company on Indeed and wanted to discuss how our ShadowProgram could help ITX Corp increase engineering productivity 2x in a 30-day pilot.
 
Our ShadowProgram pairs our ex-Google verified team of full-stack, back-end, and/or mobile engineers with your engineering team to double current engineering velocity; each of your engineer's ""Shadow"" will enable a 2-fold increase in storyboard tracker points delivered per sprint after the ShadowProgram is initiated within 30-days.
 
We've executed projects for Airware, Cape, PocketGems, Marie Kondo, The League, and over 70+ other companies and startups successfully with our ShadowProgram.
 
Our ShadowProgram often works in one of two ways –
 
1-to-1: Our engineers pair up 1-to-1 with your engineers, so each engineer on your team has a Punch Shadow that's doubling output, your engineer's ""Shadow"" is often working on the same feature or deliverable
 
Team-to-team: We split responsibilities by team, where we take certain features or milestones as well as your team members, and double overall output, often splitting up segments of work
 
I'd like to set up a call to discuss a 30-day pilot of our Shadow program with you, how does your calendar look this week and we can set up a time?

Apologies, I had a long day of work on Friday and by the end of the day, I had forgotten about sending you the MSA.
Here is the MSA model, the SoW model, and the Contractor Agreement (that the individual contractors would need to sign to be notified of the expectations around non-compete, confidentiality, etc).

Thank you for sending these over. I'll send you the signed copy shortly. 
 
Can you please specify this (screenshot below) as this is a bit confusing

As I think we are moving towards an agency contractor ship agreement the above-mentioned screenshot would not be required for us to fill.

Please find attached the signed copies of the MSA's from our side. We will keep the contractor agreement and get that signed when we start the augmentation process.
 
What does your calendar look like for Thursday or Friday this week to discuss further and start the augmentation process? 
 
Thanks,
—-----------------
 
{{Name}}
Sorry, I cannot see the screenshot you mention.
What I can provide as context, is that we use the same MSA for all types of engagements (C2C, C2H, and Direct Hire). That's why it has the provision of a ""hiring fee"" or a ""conversion fee"". 
It is the SoW that defines what is the engagement type, and in the case of agencies like yours, we would simply do a C2C, with no conversion clause. 
Hope that helps build the right context.
If you are in agreement with the MSA (understanding that it includes some clauses that will not be invoked) I can have our legal counsel send you a link for an electronic signature (with HelloSign).
—-------------------------
 
{{Name}}
Our Legal Counsel sent it on 11/04. And just re-sent e-signature through HelloSign
 
—----------------------
 
Got it now! It missed my Inbox. I have signed it from our side.
 
When are you available to discuss the next steps?
 
Thanks,

{{Name}}
I have no availability this week, but we can try to find some time for next week.
I am including {{@Name}}, {{@Name}}, and {{@Name}} on CC so that one of them can also be included in the meeting since they are the ones that are mostly taking our global searches for talent.
 
—------------------------
 
Hi {{Name}}!
 
It was great to meet you too. 
 
The person you mention, for what position would it be? So we can schedule it.
 
I share the most critical positions that we need to cover:
 
Sr Frontend Developer: {{Link}}
Sr Backend Developer: {{Link}}
System Administrator: {{Link}}
DevOps Engineer: {{Link}}
 
It is mandatory for all positions that candidates have a fluent level of English. Especially for the DevOps position, this point is totally defining since it will have direct contact with the client.
In addition to fluency, we consider that communication skills, in general, are a key point, and so the ability of multi-location and multi-cultural teamwork.
 
Another important point is the possibility of working in the client's time: {{Time}} and for DevOps and SysAdmin the person should be able to cover on-call rotations.
 
If you need any other additional information, do not hesitate to reach out.
 
Thank you!
 
Greetings.

—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.

"Data-Driven Approach to Advertising 

Punch runs a scientific Data-Driven Approach to advertising. If you have a campaign you want to A-B benchmark against or create a new campaign, our approach is your secret to unlocking hidden growth channels. Our proven system has generated positive ROI campaigns for companies.

Scenario 2 Marketing: 

We wanted to introduce our Data riven Approach to Digital Marketing, based on a 5-Step process to generate positive campaigns that pay for themselves. 

From Defining key metrics to investing and developing existing and new campaigns. Learn more: 
http://www.punch.cool/services/advertising/
",1
"Hi {{Name}}, The boilerplate package includes:

1. Consultation to understand your business and create the campaign including:
     A. Problem-solution pairs
     B. Reframing (If you sell boats, don't sell the boat, sell time on the water)
     C. Drafting invitations to do business (copy that would go into campaigns)
     D. Anticipating objections and writing objections handling collateral
 2. Design (this is an add-on option)
     A. Creating embedded images that can be used to call attention to e-mail campaigns
     B. Designing the templates for use with the marketing and objection handling collateral

After the above 2 steps are done then we will have the ability to continue with...

1. Campaign setup
      A. Organizing the campaign/campaigns into a sequence of steps (e-mail, social, phone)
      B. Tracking progress across campaigns and sales reps (open rates, click-through rates, response rates, appointment rates, proposal rates, closing rates)
      C. Continual process of renewal (revisiting campaigns that are and are not performing well, new idea generation for new invitations to do business).
2. Lead sourcing
       A. Identifying lead sources
       B. Combination of manual and automatic scraping to gather leads and find contacts at those companies
3. Launch
       A. Combining the campaign with the lead sourcing to implement the campaign, contact leads, and monitor metrics

This package is our most basic package and includes several sales reps, a sales manager, the software we use to run the campaign, and myself or one of our other senior staff to draft the invitations to do business and campaign objection handling strategy.

I hope that helps answer your question. We'd like the opportunity to work together, but we don't have much room for the price.

Our most basic package runs ~ $5k per month for the above-mentioned with a minimum commitment of 3 months.

I'm not sure where we could remove/cut while having the campaign still be effective.

For example, if we don't spend the proper time creating the campaign and move to contact customers, we will not get a good response rate. On the other hand, if we don't have the sales support to contact customers we will not do the required numbers to get appointments and ultimately won business

"Hello Simon,
 
I found you on Indeed looking for a Data & Examinations Assistant and wanted to reach out to discuss how we can help with Bridlington School's artificial intelligence/machine learning strategy.
 
We’re an ex-Google-founded engineering team specializing in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) implementations. We’ve worked on both supervised and unsupervised strategies, classification, time-series, quant/financial, and reinforcement learning problems.
 
Our general approach to ML / AI involves identifying direct and alternative data streams, causality, correlation, and importance testing, data normalization, model strategy development and tuning, hyperparameter optimization, and F-1 score tuning through meta-labeling.
 
We’ve worked with Cape, Dispatchr, 1-Page, Google, and many other companies requiring AI and ML.
 
I’d like to set up a time to discuss how Punch can help Bridlington School’s AI/ML needs.
 
Can we discuss it later this afternoon?

Hello Simon,
 
I wanted to follow up on my email below about working together on artificial intelligence/machine learning areas. I’m including a complimentary white paper that goes more in-depth on our feature engineering process for ML/AI projects including the importance of measuring not just feature correlation but causality and how to do so.
 
After you’ve had a chance to review, I’m hoping we can discuss Bridlington School ML/AI needs and how we may be able to help with AI strategy and implementation.
 
Thanks,

First my apologies for a long time between communications. We've been more than just busy and as with most projects, everything takes longer than expected.
 
In terms of our last conversation, I was able to reduce the number of pages to ~250 far less than the initial  800 and many of the pages still have a number of images ( in full size)  present. I kept the images as they are linked. with some more work, it could reduce the overall page count to ~200 or less......
 
Let me know your updated thoughts and let's continue our interaction as the other aspect of our project, web scraping using python with the appropriate returns is still in play and this database would get that off the ground effectively.

Hi {{Name}},
 
The team just went through the scope and wanted to ask about the mind map and any excel sample sheet which is mentioned in the document.
 
They seem to be missing and was wondering if you can share those with us.
 
Thanks,
—--------------
{{Name}},
 
Your previous data result ( Demo GUF data below)  and the fields are on track overall, the only real difference would be the deeper levels of descriptions for both the funding: ie.  timing of the offerings (rolling or deadlines) using our descriptors of their industries  (Industries column) for more granularity, ie: fintech then to hardware/service/software as an example.  Our schema has industries broken into subsets. Obviously, only available data for these subsets will be added to the final and ongoing database.   Does this assist in clarification?
 
 
I'm reviewing the referral agreement and will have some feedback next week.
 
Best
 
—--------------------
 
Hi {{Name}},
 
This clarifies a lot of details and we can definitely share the proposal now before the day ends tomorrow.
 
Feel free to share any feedback on the referral agreement in the meantime.

     No worries I need the press given how much email comes my way. I've seen your pdf and I'm looking forward to our call. Yes, I have time at the scheduled time with the team.   Let's chat today. 
 
—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.

"Hi Samantha,
 
Just wanted to quickly send in a quick question: 
 
For the landing page, we have a button that opens up a Calendly invite pop-up to schedule meetings. Currently, we have a dummy account put in place, but could you please send in a (preferably) Calendly invite link to put there for you?
 
Cheers
—------------------------

We don’t use Calendly at the moment.
 
What is the alternative?
—------------------

Would you happen to use any sort of Calendar application to book meetings?
 
HubSpot Calendar, TidyCal, or any of the sort might work.  
 
If you don't have a booking application in place - we could direct the users to your existing 'Contact Us' page on your website. 
 
Let me know and we can go from there.
 
Cheers

Yes we do have HubSpot calendars but we have them for each sales person…

Hi Samantha,
 
Hope you had a good weekend!
 
For the mail campaigns, could you get us the HubSpot calendar links for each sales rep? 
 
We'll set up a separate landing page and link for each sales rep.

Ok yes sure!
 
South Africa – Tendayi 
Nigeria – Michael 
Argentina and Peru – Veronica 
Brazil – Paulo 
 
When will you be kicking off this initial campaign to the MQL list?

Hey Samantha, just a quick question - in the leads you sent us we have leads from West Africa and East Africa. Which calendar link would you like us to use for each? 
 
We just need to figure out these details and we can send over a file with the appropriate links for you to launch this campaign. 
 
Cheers

No probs and thanks for checking!
 
East and South are Tendayi
 
West, North and Central are Michael

"We help companies like {{company}} design, develop and engineer products from the ground up. We specialize in Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development so you can tell right away the long-term sustainability of a product concept before investing more time and money in creating all possible features. This significantly reduces your long-term risk.

Our MVP program follows 4 key Concept-to-Reality steps:

Brainstorming — We define the product using SWOT analysis, revenue model validation, product differentiation from competitors, and key feature definition.

Prioritizing — We define the feature timeline by shortlisting those features with maximum benefits, defining the minimum viable product, and by removing non-critical features from the pipeline.

Developing — We take the MVP project from concept to code by including QA, project management, a seasoned coding team, daily coding, creation of the minimum viable product, bi-weekly release cycle, continuous improvement, and weekly meetings to review product progress.

Scaling — We build the future, today, by preparing for mass commercialization, by planning out versions 2?5 features, and by identifying new sources of capital and growth.

Check out: http://www.punch.cool/services/engineering/

We would love to set up a call to discuss your concept, and to answer a few key questions. From this, we will return our complete analysis and proposed MVP timeline.

When do you have about 15 minutes to chat?

Can you handle the following client request below?
 
The Cleanliness Index is a set of standards that can be used to measure the cleanliness of the City of Miami Beach’s public areas. The Cleanliness Index scheduling web application was developed using Microsoft’s Silverlight technology and Microsoft will be discontinuing support of Silverlight technology on October 12, 2021. The dropping of support for this technology facilitates the need to redevelop the Cleanliness scheduling application utilizing current web development technologies.
The current cleanliness scheduling application provides the following main areas of functionality:
1. Displays a printable calendar containing predefined assignments.
2. Allows for jobs contained within the calendar to be assigned to users.
3. Generates printable driving directions providing the optimal route to visit each task within the selected
assessment.
Parties interested in being considered by the City for the services described herein should submit a proposal in
accordance with Section 4, Submittal Instructions and Format. Responsive proposals will be evaluated in accordance
with the criteria established in Section 7, Evaluation of Responses.
 
 
Statement of Work Required. Consultant shall create a web app using JavaScript Libraries and HTML5 that performs
the following:
1. Displays a printable calendar containing predefined assignments. Jobs are predefined from a Microsoft
SQL database routine and would populate the calendar. The calendar should be created using jQuery
Full Calendar JavaScript Calendar or equivalent.
2. Allows for jobs contained within the calendar to be assigned to users by clicking on the job.
3. Store users in a Microsoft SQL database.
4. Allows the assessor to have the option to display printable driving directions providing the optimal route
to visit each task within the selected Assessment. The routing routine should use a navigation software
app.

"{{Name}},
 
First my apologies for a long time between communications. We've been more than just busy and as with most projects, everything takes longer than expected.
 
In terms of our last conversation, I was able to reduce the number of pages to ~250 far less than the initial  800 and many of the pages still have a number of images ( in full size)  present. I kept the images as they are linked. with some more work, it could reduce the overall page count to ~200 or less......
 
Let me know your updated thoughts and let's continue our interaction as the other aspect of our project, web scraping using python with the appropriate returns is still in play and this database would get that off the ground effectively.

{{Name}} and I together with our programmers will be spending some additional time defining the scope of work update we spoke of last week. We will be deploying the SOW to your firm next week. 
 
I apologize for the delay however, it's better for both our firms to have the granularity needed to ensure a great outcome.  
 
Not certain if I missed the referral agreement we discussed?
 
Will be in touch next week, with updated details.

Hi {{Name}},
 
That sounds like a plan. We can jump on a quick call as soon as you will share something with us.
 
In terms of the next steps. we would love to put together a quick proposal outlining the cost and the estimates there.
 
I will follow up on {{Day}} again if I would not hear from you by then.
 
Thanks,

As promised the updated SOW. 
 
I trust that this will clarify our engagement a bit more deeply than the minimal statement in the last proposal you sent.
 
Any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
 
Also want to follow up on a referral agreement...
 
Best,

Hi {{Name}},
 
Happy {{Day}} and thank you for putting these details together. I have already shared it with our team and they might come up with some questions today or tomorrow.
 
In the meantime, we will start working on putting together a quick proposal and aim to share it by {{Day}}/{{Day}} this week.
 
Do you have any availability for a quick call this{{Day}}/{{Day}}? The afternoons work best for us.

Hi {{Name}},
 
The team just went through the scope and wanted to ask about the mind map and any excel sample sheet which is mentioned in the document.
 
They seem to be missing and was wondering if you can share those with us.
 
Thanks,
—--------------
{{Name}},
 
Your previous data result ( Demo GUF data below)  and the fields are on track overall, the only real difference would be the deeper levels of descriptions for both the funding: ie.  timing of the offerings (rolling or deadlines) using our descriptors of their industries  (Industries column) for more granularity, ie: fintech then to hardware/service/software as an example.  Our schema has industries broken into subsets. Obviously, only available data for these subsets will be added to the final and ongoing database.   Does this assist in clarification?
 
 
I'm reviewing the referral agreement and will have some feedback next week.
 
Best
 
—--------------------
 
Hi {{Name}},
 
This clarifies a lot of details and we can definitely share the proposal now before the day ends tomorrow.
 
Feel free to share any feedback on the referral agreement in the meantime.

I had a chance to talk to our Director of Sales about the platform and its functionality. Unfortunately, at this point we are not going to move forward, however there may be opportunity in the future to implement.
 
Thank you so much for taking the time to set up the demos with me – I think the platform is really interesting concept!
 
Have a great weekend,

"Hi {{Name}}, The boilerplate package includes:

1. Consultation to understand your business and create the campaign including:
     A. Problem-solution pairs
     B. Reframing (If you sell boats, don't sell the boat, sell time on the water)
     C. Drafting invitations to do business (copy that would go into campaigns)
     D. Anticipating objections and writing objections handling collateral
 2. Design (this is an add-on option)
     A. Creating embedded images that can be used to call attention to e-mail campaigns
     B. Designing the templates for use with the marketing and objection handling collateral

After the above 2 steps are done then we will have the ability to continue with...

1. Campaign setup
      A. Organizing the campaign/campaigns into a sequence of steps (e-mail, social, phone)
      B. Tracking progress across campaigns and sales reps (open rates, click-through rates, response rates, appointment rates, proposal rates, closing rates)
      C. Continual process of renewal (revisiting campaigns that are and are not performing well, new idea generation for new invitations to do business).
2. Lead sourcing
       A. Identifying lead sources
       B. Combination of manual and automatic scraping to gather leads and find contacts at those companies
3. Launch
       A. Combining the campaign with the lead sourcing to implement the campaign, contact leads, and monitor metrics

This package is our most basic package and includes several sales reps, a sales manager, the software we use to run the campaign, and myself or one of our other senior staff to draft the invitations to do business and campaign objection handling strategy.

I hope that helps answer your question. We'd like the opportunity to work together, but we don't have much room for the price.

Our most basic package runs ~ $5k per month for the above-mentioned with a minimum commitment of 3 months.

I'm not sure where we could remove/cut while having the campaign still be effective.

For example, if we don't spend the proper time creating the campaign and move to contact customers, we will not get a good response rate. On the other hand, if we don't have the sales support to contact customers we will not do the required numbers to get appointments and ultimately won business

"Also, here's a brief update of what's been done from our side;
As per our last call, we pre-processed the data you sent us which includes measures like removing Chinese from blog data,
and removing HTML tags for model adaptation & training. If needed or requested by you, we can provide the pre-processed script or
data to you.
We were able to train the model to generate pretty good blogs as per your requirements and have been able to meet the criteria
discussed last week, which are;
1. HTML Generated output (similar to the data you sent to us. We pre-processed it for fine-tuning and training and now can
deliver an output embedded with HTML tags as per your requirement.)
2. Links embedded; the blog data that is generated will now be populated with respective links from the data that was sent over.
I'm attaching the API in the email attachment, please test it and send in any or all feedback you have for us.
We can either generate the data programmatically in any format (CSV HTML, etc) or you can use the API and generate it. Let
us know what you prefer.
Let us know if you have any questions,",1

"Hello {{Name}}, We help companies like {{company}} fill their B2B sales pipelines with highly qualified prospects, increasing revenue. Our B2B growth program includes 4 major steps:
1. Research
2. Demand Generation
3. Meetings/Appointments (relationship building)
4. Closing (revenue generation)
These four steps generate a revenue-building system from scratch. This means that, unlike other companies, we do more than merely set appointments. For instance, our team of researchers gathers live data for prospects who are in the market, right now, for your solution. We do this by accessing 10,000+ job boards, conference listings, and more, building a list of active prospects. From there, our sales team reaches out to these potential customers to set up appointments. Then, we loop in your team to these appointments, including pitch writing, adjustment, analysis, relationship building and finally closing. Once we start working together, we will write the pitches using your collateral, and schedule a kickoff with our sales and research teams to consult with you on constructing the initial lists.

"Hi {{Name}}, The boilerplate package includes:

1. Consultation to understand your business and create the campaign including:
     A. Problem-solution pairs
     B. Reframing (If you sell boats, don't sell the boat, sell time on the water)
     C. Drafting invitations to do business (copy that would go into campaigns)
     D. Anticipating objections and writing objections handling collateral
 2. Design (this is an add-on option)
     A. Creating embedded images that can be used to call attention to e-mail campaigns
     B. Designing the templates for use with the marketing and objection handling collateral

After the above 2 steps are done then we will have the ability to continue with...

1. Campaign setup
      A. Organizing the campaign/campaigns into a sequence of steps (e-mail, social, phone)
      B. Tracking progress across campaigns and sales reps (open rates, click-through rates, response rates, appointment rates, proposal rates, closing rates)
      C. Continual process of renewal (revisiting campaigns that are and are not performing well, new idea generation for new invitations to do business).
2. Lead sourcing
       A. Identifying lead sources
       B. Combination of manual and automatic scraping to gather leads and find contacts at those companies
3. Launch
       A. Combining the campaign with the lead sourcing to implement the campaign, contact leads, and monitor metrics

This package is our most basic package and includes several sales reps, a sales manager, the software we use to run the campaign, and myself or one of our other senior staff to draft the invitations to do business and campaign objection handling strategy.

I hope that helps answer your question. We'd like the opportunity to work together, but we don't have much room for the price.

Our most basic package runs ~ $5k per month for the above-mentioned with a minimum commitment of 3 months.

I'm not sure where we could remove/cut while having the campaign still be effective.

For example, if we don't spend the proper time creating the campaign and move to contact customers, we will not get a good response rate. On the other hand, if we don't have the sales support to contact customers we will not do the required numbers to get appointments and ultimately won business

"Hi {{Name}}, Thanks for reaching out. To launch and maintain these campaigns is an enormous amount of work. We need to spend the time to...
 
1. Understand your business
2. Think creatively about how to reach customers (invitations to do business derived from problem-solution pairs).
3. Identify creative ways to find leads.
4. Create the campaigns in a way where we have a 360-degree view of the customer (Social, email, phone, chat)
5. Work the pipeline and stay engaged while we help build a relationship with the prospect
6. Ultimately move them along to a close.
 
In addition to the above steps, we have to work with clients on upgrading their collateral and website because those pieces dictate the extent to which we can support them.
 
I understand that you would like to move forward however we cannot do this work without being paid for it. I understand that you want a results-driven team, however, our outreach projects are structured with both components:
 
A.) A monthly stipend to pay the bills and all the above creative work.
B.) A contingency commission that is paid to the sales rep for them to stay motivated.
 
I think you will have a hard time finding a quality team that will execute what you want strictly on a contingency basis.
 
If things change feel free to reach out.

I completely understand your concern regarding the timelines and cost estimates that we have proposed for this project. As far as the proportionality of pricing to the efficiency and quality of work are related, Punch’s expertise will never be questioned from your side, we make sure we deliver within the timelines that have been put forward by our team.
 
Also, as we had a brief intro, I would suggest a detailed discussion of your necessities and extent of work in our next call and that will allow me to revise the cost and timelines more accurately, taking into account the current needs of {{Company}}.
Let’s get on the phone and talk this out further.
 
Best Regards.

"We help companies like {{company}} design, develop and engineer products from the ground up. We specialize in Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development so you can tell right away the long-term sustainability of a product concept before investing more time and money in creating all possible features. This significantly reduces your long-term risk.

Our MVP program follows 4 key Concept-to-Reality steps:

Brainstorming — We define the product using SWOT analysis, revenue model validation, product differentiation from competitors, and key feature definition.

Prioritizing — We define the feature timeline by shortlisting those features with maximum benefits, defining the minimum viable product, and by removing non-critical features from the pipeline.

Developing — We take the MVP project from concept to code by including QA, project management, a seasoned coding team, daily coding, creation of the minimum viable product, bi-weekly release cycle, continuous improvement, and weekly meetings to review product progress.

Scaling — We build the future, today, by preparing for mass commercialization, by planning out versions 2?5 features, and by identifying new sources of capital and growth.

Check out: http://www.punch.cool/services/engineering/

We would love to set up a call to discuss your concept, and to answer a few key questions. From this, we will return our complete analysis and proposed MVP timeline.

When do you have about 15 minutes to chat?

Cheers,

—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.

"Hi {{Name}}, We help companies like {{company}} boost their B2C visibility, market share and profit through Punch’s B2C growth program. This program consists of a 4-step process:

1. Analysis — We dive deep into ads being run by your top 1 to 3 competitors on Facebook, AdWords, Google+, etc., to understand what they’re doing right and what you could be doing better. We perform analyses on keywords, SEO, website traffic and app store traffic, to see where you may be missing golden opportunities and where you may be losing your visitors. We gather data on,
Who are your customers?
How {{company}} is doing with getting them?
What does it cost to acquire a new customer?

This data helps us understand the hopes and fears of your prospects and how best to harness those attitudes to help them become new customers.

2. Plan creation — We take a survey of {{company}}’s current marketing channels to see what is being done now. This helps us understand what steps are being left out and what opportunities are being missed. Next, we analyze marketing channels new to {{company}} to determine the best approach for expanding your market reach. This is followed by tailoring a plan to achieve specific advertising milestones:
to grow every month {{company}}’s number of customers,
to get more engagement from existing customers which will strengthen their commitment to the {{company}} brand, and
to reduce customer churn.

We target double-digit, month-on-month growth in the initial, 90-day test, and an overall 50% reduction in customer churn.

3. Execution — We execute the plan, which always starts with original content creation. The plan includes monitoring and analysis of incremental results, plus daily meetings to review progress. It also includes ads management, engagement metrics, and regular performance review. We update the plan with any required changes to ensure we meet plan goals.

4. Refinement — We make daily, weekly, and monthly adjustments to the plan based on ongoing performance. Such refinements are based on monthly and quarterly customer acquisition, plus CPC and CPM benchmarks and metrics.

Overall goals:
Double-digit, month-on-month growth in new customers,
Grow existing customer engagement by 50%,
Reduce customer churn by 50%, and
Reduce ad cost per new customer acquisition by at least 20%.

"We help companies like {{company}} design, develop and engineer products from the ground up. We specialize in Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development so you can tell right away the long-term sustainability of a product concept before investing more time and money in creating all possible features. This significantly reduces your long-term risk.

Our MVP program follows 4 key Concept-to-Reality steps:

Brainstorming — We define the product using SWOT analysis, revenue model validation, product differentiation from competitors, and key feature definition.

Prioritizing — We define the feature timeline by shortlisting those features with maximum benefits, defining the minimum viable product, and by removing non-critical features from the pipeline.

Developing — We take the MVP project from concept to code by including QA, project management, a seasoned coding team, daily coding, creation of the minimum viable product, bi-weekly release cycle, continuous improvement, and weekly meetings to review product progress.

Scaling — We build the future, today, by preparing for mass commercialization, by planning out versions 2?5 features, and by identifying new sources of capital and growth.

Check out: http://www.punch.cool/services/engineering/

We would love to set up a call to discuss your concept, and to answer a few key questions. From this, we will return our complete analysis and proposed MVP timeline.

3. Meetings/Appointments (relationship building)
4. Closing (revenue generation)
These four steps generate a revenue-building system from scratch. This means that, unlike other companies, we do more than merely set appointments. For instance, our team of researchers gathers live data for prospects who are in the market, right now, for your solution. We do this by accessing 10,000+ job boards, conference listings, and more, building a list of active prospects. From there, our sales team reaches out to these potential customers to set up appointments. Then, we loop in your team to these appointments, including pitch writing, adjustment, analysis, relationship building and finally closing. Once we start working together, we will write the pitches using your collateral, and schedule a kickoff with our sales and research teams to consult with you on constructing the initial lists.

Hi,
 
FYI – for the last 2 days we have had poor ISP service, this morning it was extremely bad.  Fortunately, the ISP provider technician found a bad junction wire at the pole just this morning (I just finished meeting with him), he replaced it and we now seem to have a solid connection and transfer rates.
 
I’m sharing this because if a new meeting time was sent I didn’t get it.  I have read the PP sent to me and I don’t have any questions at this time, I want to present it to Management on {{Day}}/{{Day}} and will use the PP for reference.
 
I propose, all things considered, we re-schedule after I have had a discussion with Management; does that sound good to you?

Hi,
 
The meeting was held this morning with the same end result which is ‘hold’; primarily because one customer's implementation schedule was pushed out a quarter due to them having infra challenges.  This buys us a little breathing room but I am impressed with them it is only a short stay and we need to address this both in the intermediate-term and how it can be an option for any future… bottlenecks.

"Hello Simon,
 
I found you on Indeed looking for a Data & Examinations Assistant and wanted to reach out to discuss how we can help with Bridlington School's artificial intelligence/machine learning strategy.
 
We’re an ex-Google-founded engineering team specializing in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) implementations. We’ve worked on both supervised and unsupervised strategies, classification, time-series, quant/financial, and reinforcement learning problems.
 
Our general approach to ML / AI involves identifying direct and alternative data streams, causality, correlation, and importance testing, data normalization, model strategy development and tuning, hyperparameter optimization, and F-1 score tuning through meta-labeling.
 
We’ve worked with Cape, Dispatchr, 1-Page, Google, and many other companies requiring AI and ML.
 
I’d like to set up a time to discuss how Punch can help Bridlington School’s AI/ML needs.
 
Can we discuss it later this afternoon?

Hello Simon,
 
I wanted to follow up on my email below about working together on artificial intelligence/machine learning areas. I’m including a complimentary white paper that goes more in-depth on our feature engineering process for ML/AI projects including the importance of measuring not just feature correlation but causality and how to do so.
 
After you’ve had a chance to review, I’m hoping we can discuss Bridlington School ML/AI needs and how we may be able to help with AI strategy and implementation.
 
Thanks,

Hi,
 
FYI – for the last 2 days we have had poor ISP service, this morning it was extremely bad.  Fortunately, the ISP provider technician found a bad junction wire at the pole just this morning (I just finished meeting with him), he replaced it and we now seem to have a solid connection and transfer rates.
 
I’m sharing this because if a new meeting time was sent I didn’t get it.  I have read the PP sent to me and I don’t have any questions at this time, I want to present it to Management on {{Day}}/{{Day}} and will use the PP for reference.
 
I propose, all things considered, we re-schedule after I have had a discussion with Management; does that sound good to you?

Hi {{Name}}, checking in – what are the next steps?

Hi {{Name}},
 
We had a meeting on resource planning today, and a lot of scenarios were discussed, the position is ‘hold’ for now and we are meeting again on {{Month}} {{Date}}; so I should no more then.

Hi {{Name}}, following up on {{Name}} email below. How'd the planning meeting on {{Month}} {{Date}}?
 
Would love to learn more and discuss how we can help {{Company_Name}} build projects with our engineering and design teams.

Hi,
 
The meeting was held this morning with the same end result which is ‘hold’; primarily because one customer's implementation schedule was pushed out a quarter due to them having infra challenges.  This buys us a little breathing room but I am impressed with them it is only a short stay and we need to address this both in the intermediate-term and how it can be an option for any future… bottlenecks.
 
I appreciate the check-in, for now, we have to wait and see.",1

Hey Raahim,
     No worries I need the press given how much email comes my way. I've seen your pdf and I'm looking forward to our call. Yes, I have time at the scheduled time with the team.   Let's chat today. 
 
—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.

Regarding the data format, is approved client content that covers a new topic the model hasn't been trained on yet but that doesn't have any search queries associated to it still usable for training purposes?
 
Adam

Hi Adam,
 
It would be helpful to have at least one query associated with the content, also we can normalize the data with the previous data we have by adding in data labeling for $1,500 one-time cost.
 
Thanks,

Thanks Sherry
 
We'll make sure there's at least 1 query per piece then, hopefully more.
 
Just to confirm the quote includes doing any necessary clean-up on the copy right? Last time you guys did stuff like stripping out HTML before training.

Hi Sherry
 
Thanks for this, I am still waiting for sign off on this but will review as and when we get there.
 
Regarding the API costs, do you mean for the old project, this project or both projects? In either case I need a bit more than advance notice of an invoice coming in.  I need a clear means of reporting so I can see usage and predict future costs. I'll take your suggestion but if you have no specific format in mind I would personally recommend a shared spreadsheet that you can keep updated with two tables (one per project), entering details of payments and usage as in the example attached - would this work for you? If so I can upload to our sharepoint and share with you.

Hi Adam,
 
The format works great for us. We can use this format for reporting the API cost and usage every month and you will be notified every time we update the sheet.

Sherry,
 
Can you handle the following client request below?
 
The Cleanliness Index is a set of standards that can be used to measure the cleanliness of the City of Miami Beach’s public areas. The Cleanliness Index scheduling web application was developed using Microsoft’s Silverlight technology and Microsoft will be discontinuing support of Silverlight technology on October 12, 2021. The dropping of support for this technology facilitates the need to redevelop the Cleanliness scheduling application utilizing current web development technologies.
The current cleanliness scheduling application provides the following main areas of functionality:
1. Displays a printable calendar containing predefined assignments.
2. Allows for jobs contained within the calendar to be assigned to users.
3. Generates printable driving directions providing the optimal route to visit each task within the selected
assessment.
Parties interested in being considered by the City for the services described herein should submit a proposal in
accordance with Section 4, Submittal Instructions and Format. Responsive proposals will be evaluated in accordance
with the criteria established in Section 7, Evaluation of Responses.
 
 
Statement of Work Required. Consultant shall create a web app using JavaScript Libraries and HTML5 that performs
the following:
1. Displays a printable calendar containing predefined assignments. Jobs are predefined from a Microsoft
SQL database routine and would populate the calendar. The calendar should be created using jQuery
Full Calendar JavaScript Calendar or equivalent.
2. Allows for jobs contained within the calendar to be assigned to users by clicking on the job.
3. Store users in a Microsoft SQL database.
4. Allows the assessor to have the option to display printable driving directions providing the optimal route
to visit each task within the selected Assessment. The routing routine should use a navigation software
app.

Hey Sherry,
 
Thanks for this I’ll have a look.
 
I’d love your take on the app as well.
 
Can you send the separate proposal for that?
 
Much appreciated,

Hi Kalyna,
 
I would love to put together a proposal if I will have any details on the scope of work. It will allow us to share some team details, timelines, and cost estimates.
 
I can put together a quick document on the pricing and what you can expect from the team on Design and Development.
 
Let me know what you think and I can keep it moving forward here.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
 
—---------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
A proposal ASAP before end of week would be very useful with a timeline (week over week) estimated delivery, cost and such so we can go to investors and be sure to get moving into development.
 
There is a current async ML component. We are not married to the idea of having to tie all of those models in real time to Zoom. However, they do need to show up in a meaningful way on the client’s dashboard at some point.
 
Most immediately, if we can get something showing people real time insights in meetings, we are WELL on our way to the next stage of our MVP.
 
Here is an example product: 
 
This is another one (although they built their own video meeting area, we do NOT want to do that but rather plug in as Equalicert has.):
 
 
We do NOT want to be a DEI product but a performance improvement, management, leadership, professional development product.
 
 
Here’s an overview:
 
 
This is the general UX idea.
 
- React/Node
- Python Tensorflow for the AWS ML Models
- We have NLP, and use Audio, Video and the Chat to analyze Emotions (audio) Video (eye movements for engagement) but we are not set on all of our models being integrated right now depending on what's fastest/easiest/possible to integrate to talk in real time with a zoom meeting.
 
Ideally we want:
- Interruption notifications (If someone is interrupting a lot, they get a ping)
- Speaking time (depending on context - so we have 8 different use cases roughly, if someone is monopolizing the conversation based on the context of the call, they get pinged. We will provide the % speaking time intervals for you)
- Emotions (help the meeting leader and individual participants understand how they sound. Is there voice coming across as stressed? anxious? Are they speaking faster than normal? We want to let them know.)*** This will set us apart if you can do this in real time by hooking up to the audio of the meeting and running it through our ML model during the meeting time and sending that information back to the Zoom user in a panel.
 
If we had those three prompts (integrating the machine learning models or not) this would be a HUGE win.
 
Core Deliverables:
- We need a Zoom marketplace approval for the app so users can download it using the marketplace: (we are not set on Zoom but it is preferrable. We need to start somewhere and ultimately will need to move to Teams, Meet capabilities so whatever direction we start in is fine.)
- Paywall for users to be able to pay in order to use the service, usage based, 10 hours meetings free then a price per hour, not determined yet.
In AWS our own app on where users can log in and see their meeting history results
- Admin dashboards (in the mockups) for an administrator of a company (group individual users into the company, also for managers of teams or teachers of a class for example who might need access to aggregated statistics based on groups of individuals in their organization) and
- Individual user dashboard (individual meeting stats that are collected)
 
Our current ML models can already use recordings to analyze videos so we need to hook those up to the dashboard. We have a terrible dashboard on bubble that we need to migrate over essentially. We use integromat to automate sequences.
 
I’ve got this to our devs, but I think I am missing some “tech” vocabulary and direction on this. 
 
Please let me know.
 
Thanks!
  
Kalyna

Hi Kalyna,
 
We will start working on this first thing tomorrow and I will reach out to you if there will be any questions from the team.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry

Great – as for the other pitch, I’m seeing $1,000/month for two individuals to run email campaigns?
 
Are they doing appointment setting?
 
As mentioned on that end I was looking for a guaranteed result of some sort before paying for further BD/Sales help.
 
Thanks,
Kalyna
—--------------------
 
Hi Kalyna,
 
My apologies for taking longer than expected to get back to you but there were a few thorough details our team had to go through.
 
Please find below the link for the proposal.
{{Link}}
 
Happy to jump on a quick call to answer any questions. Afternoons work best for us.
 
For the email marketing campaigns, our original proposal was only revolving around LeadGen but we can surely offer you more for less as the referrals are our key interest here. We are right working on scaling our technology right now and are only a few weeks away. Please read about it here: 
{{Link}} (draft version)
 
Feel free to share any thoughts.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
 
—--------------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
Thanks for this.
 
This quote is way out of budget for an MVP. How can you reduce this? I especially think 8 weeks for UX is extreme given our current wireframes already in existence, Zoom’s UI to leverage in app and the simplicity of what dashboard we’re asking for users to have access to meeting data.
 
If we were to simplify this MVP even further, what’s the cheapest you can go on a Zoom Marketplace app, integrating some basics like Equalicert has?
Would it be easier on Google as an extension like they have done?
 
I would love a few different options please.
 
Also, in your figmatic link, your videos are unaligned to the laptop screens.
 
I’ve attached an image for your reference.
 
If you can do something on the lead gen side, let me know. I’d love a trial or something along with the promise of sending you referrals upon success. I think this in combination with the MVP development would be a sweetspot for us.
 
Thanks!
 
Warmly,
Kalyna

"Hi {{Name}}, We help companies like {{company}} boost their B2C visibility, market share and profit through Punch’s B2C growth program. This program consists of a 4-step process:

1. Analysis — We dive deep into ads being run by your top 1 to 3 competitors on Facebook, AdWords, Google+, etc., to understand what they’re doing right and what you could be doing better. We perform analyses on keywords, SEO, website traffic and app store traffic, to see where you may be missing golden opportunities and where you may be losing your visitors. We gather data on,
Who are your customers?
How {{company}} is doing with getting them?
What does it cost to acquire a new customer?

This data helps us understand the hopes and fears of your prospects and how best to harness those attitudes to help them become new customers.

2. Plan creation — We take a survey of {{company}}’s current marketing channels to see what is being done now. This helps us understand what steps are being left out and what opportunities are being missed. Next, we analyze marketing channels new to {{company}} to determine the best approach for expanding your market reach. This is followed by tailoring a plan to achieve specific advertising milestones:
to grow every month {{company}}’s number of customers,
to get more engagement from existing customers which will strengthen their commitment to the {{company}} brand, and
to reduce customer churn.

We target double-digit, month-on-month growth in the initial, 90-day test, and an overall 50% reduction in customer churn.

3. Execution — We execute the plan, which always starts with original content creation. The plan includes monitoring and analysis of incremental results, plus daily meetings to review progress. It also includes ads management, engagement metrics, and regular performance review. We update the plan with any required changes to ensure we meet plan goals.

4. Refinement — We make daily, weekly, and monthly adjustments to the plan based on ongoing performance. Such refinements are based on monthly and quarterly customer acquisition, plus CPC and CPM benchmarks and metrics.

Overall goals:
Double-digit, month-on-month growth in new customers,
Grow existing customer engagement by 50%,
Reduce customer churn by 50%, and
Reduce ad cost per new customer acquisition by at least 20%.

Hi {{Name}},
 
We really liked the scrum master/TPM and the Salesforce developer.  We wanted to know if you have any more candidates we can talk to for the full-stack role?
 
Thanks,

Hi {{Name}},
 
Thank you for the feedback. We have a few of them available as we also work in the same tech stack for our own products.
 
We can introduce you to a couple of them in another session and we can proceed with the one that suits your needs more. I will have their resumes shared with {{Name}} before our session as well.
 
Let me know about your availability and I will make the arrangements accordingly. Anytime in the morning and early afternoon works best for us.
 
Thanks,

Hi {{Name}},
 
We still want to work with {{Our Company}} and are confident you can find a great fit for the Full Stack developer as well.  Can you send me the proposal and contract information? We want to move forward and get you guys engaged as soon as possible.

I appreciate your trust and confidence in our abilities. We are thrilled with the possibility of moving forward as we have waited since our introduction in {{Month}} last year.
 
We have already started working on the proposal along with the services agreement and will share it with you by day end of tomorrow.
 
Feel free to reach out for any questions you might have. I would aim to set up a kick-off call early next week if that works for you.

—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.

"Hi Kalyna,
 
Please find below the proposal for the LiveLeads by Punch. We would love to get the ball rolling here as it will allow us to explore many other opportunities.

Hey Sherry,
 
Thanks for this I’ll have a look.
 
I’d love your take on the app as well.
 
Can you send the separate proposal for that?
 
Much appreciated,
Kalyna 
 
—---------------------
 
Hi Kalyna,
 
I would love to put together a proposal if I will have any details on the scope of work. It will allow us to share some team details, timelines, and cost estimates.
 
I can put together a quick document on the pricing and what you can expect from the team on Design and Development.
 
Let me know what you think and I can keep it moving forward here.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
 
—---------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
A proposal ASAP before end of week would be very useful with a timeline (week over week) estimated delivery, cost and such so we can go to investors and be sure to get moving into development.
 
There is a current async ML component. We are not married to the idea of having to tie all of those models in real time to Zoom. However, they do need to show up in a meaningful way on the client’s dashboard at some point.
 
Most immediately, if we can get something showing people real time insights in meetings, we are WELL on our way to the next stage of our MVP.
 
Here is an example product: 
 
This is another one (although they built their own video meeting area, we do NOT want to do that but rather plug in as Equalicert has.):
 
 
We do NOT want to be a DEI product but a performance improvement, management, leadership, professional development product.
 
 
Here’s an overview:
 
 
This is the general UX idea.
 
- React/Node
- Python Tensorflow for the AWS ML Models
- We have NLP, and use Audio, Video and the Chat to analyze Emotions (audio) Video (eye movements for engagement) but we are not set on all of our models being integrated right now depending on what's fastest/easiest/possible to integrate to talk in real time with a zoom meeting.
 
Ideally we want:
- Interruption notifications (If someone is interrupting a lot, they get a ping)
- Speaking time (depending on context - so we have 8 different use cases roughly, if someone is monopolizing the conversation based on the context of the call, they get pinged. We will provide the % speaking time intervals for you)
- Emotions (help the meeting leader and individual participants understand how they sound. Is there voice coming across as stressed? anxious? Are they speaking faster than normal? We want to let them know.)*** This will set us apart if you can do this in real time by hooking up to the audio of the meeting and running it through our ML model during the meeting time and sending that information back to the Zoom user in a panel.
 
If we had those three prompts (integrating the machine learning models or not) this would be a HUGE win.
 
Core Deliverables:
- We need a Zoom marketplace approval for the app so users can download it using the marketplace: (we are not set on Zoom but it is preferrable. We need to start somewhere and ultimately will need to move to Teams, Meet capabilities so whatever direction we start in is fine.)
- Paywall for users to be able to pay in order to use the service, usage based, 10 hours meetings free then a price per hour, not determined yet.
In AWS our own app on where users can log in and see their meeting history results
- Admin dashboards (in the mockups) for an administrator of a company (group individual users into the company, also for managers of teams or teachers of a class for example who might need access to aggregated statistics based on groups of individuals in their organization) and
- Individual user dashboard (individual meeting stats that are collected)
 
Our current ML models can already use recordings to analyze videos so we need to hook those up to the dashboard. We have a terrible dashboard on bubble that we need to migrate over essentially. We use integromat to automate sequences.
 
I’ve got this to our devs, but I think I am missing some “tech” vocabulary and direction on this. 
 
Please let me know.
 
Thanks!
  
Kalyna
—--------------------
 
Hi Kalyna,
 
We will start working on this first thing tomorrow and I will reach out to you if there will be any questions from the team.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
—--------------------
 
Great – as for the other pitch, I’m seeing $1,000/month for two individuals to run email campaigns?
 
Are they doing appointment setting?
 
As mentioned on that end I was looking for a guaranteed result of some sort before paying for further BD/Sales help.
 
Thanks,
Kalyna
—--------------------
 
Hi Kalyna,
 
My apologies for taking longer than expected to get back to you but there were a few thorough details our team had to go through.
 
Please find below the link for the proposal.
{{Link}}
 
Happy to jump on a quick call to answer any questions. Afternoons work best for us.
 
For the email marketing campaigns, our original proposal was only revolving around LeadGen but we can surely offer you more for less as the referrals are our key interest here. We are right working on scaling our technology right now and are only a few weeks away. Please read about it here: 
{{Link}} (draft version)
 
Feel free to share any thoughts.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
 
—--------------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
Thanks for this.
 
This quote is way out of budget for an MVP. How can you reduce this? I especially think 8 weeks for UX is extreme given our current wireframes already in existence, Zoom’s UI to leverage in app and the simplicity of what dashboard we’re asking for users to have access to meeting data.
 
If we were to simplify this MVP even further, what’s the cheapest you can go on a Zoom Marketplace app, integrating some basics like Equalicert has?
Would it be easier on Google as an extension like they have done?
 
I would love a few different options please.
 
Also, in your figmatic link, your videos are unaligned to the laptop screens.
 
I’ve attached an image for your reference.
 
If you can do something on the lead gen side, let me know. I’d love a trial or something along with the promise of sending you referrals upon success. I think this in combination with the MVP development would be a sweetspot for us.
 
Thanks!
 
Warmly,
Kalyna

Take our 3-candidate in the 24-hour challenge.3-candidates in 24 hours. That's our promise.

Hi,
 
FYI – for the last 2 days we have had poor ISP service, this morning it was extremely bad.  Fortunately, the ISP provider technician found a bad junction wire at the pole just this morning (I just finished meeting with him), he replaced it and we now seem to have a solid connection and transfer rates.
 
I’m sharing this because if a new meeting time was sent I didn’t get it.  I have read the PP sent to me and I don’t have any questions at this time, I want to present it to Management on {{Day}}/{{Day}} and will use the PP for reference.
 
I propose, all things considered, we re-schedule after I have had a discussion with Management; does that sound good to you?

Hi,
 
The meeting was held this morning with the same end result which is ‘hold’; primarily because one customer's implementation schedule was pushed out a quarter due to them having infra challenges.  This buys us a little breathing room but I am impressed with them it is only a short stay and we need to address this both in the intermediate-term and how it can be an option for any future… bottlenecks.

"Hi Samantha,
 
Just wanted to quickly send in a quick question: 
 
For the landing page, we have a button that opens up a Calendly invite pop-up to schedule meetings. Currently, we have a dummy account put in place, but could you please send in a (preferably) Calendly invite link to put there for you?
 
Cheers

We don’t use Calendly at the moment.
 
What is the alternative?

Would you happen to use any sort of Calendar application to book meetings?
 
HubSpot Calendar, TidyCal, or any of the sort might work.  
 
If you don't have a booking application in place - we could direct the users to your existing 'Contact Us' page on your website. 
 
Let me know and we can go from there.

"Hello {{Name}}, We help companies like {{company}} fill their B2B sales pipelines with highly qualified prospects, increasing revenue. Our B2B growth program includes 4 major steps:
1. Research
2. Demand Generation
3. Meetings/Appointments (relationship building)
4. Closing (revenue generation)
These four steps generate a revenue-building system from scratch. This means that, unlike other companies, we do more than merely set appointments. For instance, our team of researchers gathers live data for prospects who are in the market, right now, for your solution. We do this by accessing 10,000+ job boards, conference listings, and more, building a list of active prospects. From there, our sales team reaches out to these potential customers to set up appointments. Then, we loop in your team to these appointments, including pitch writing, adjustment, analysis, relationship building and finally closing. Once we start working together, we will write the pitches using your collateral, and schedule a kickoff with our sales and research teams to consult with you on constructing the initial lists.

Can you handle the following client request below?
 
The Cleanliness Index is a set of standards that can be used to measure the cleanliness of the City of Miami Beach’s public areas. The Cleanliness Index scheduling web application was developed using Microsoft’s Silverlight technology and Microsoft will be discontinuing support of Silverlight technology on October 12, 2021. The dropping of support for this technology facilitates the need to redevelop the Cleanliness scheduling application utilizing current web development technologies.
The current cleanliness scheduling application provides the following main areas of functionality:
1. Displays a printable calendar containing predefined assignments.
2. Allows for jobs contained within the calendar to be assigned to users.
3. Generates printable driving directions providing the optimal route to visit each task within the selected
assessment.
Parties interested in being considered by the City for the services described herein should submit a proposal in
accordance with Section 4, Submittal Instructions and Format. Responsive proposals will be evaluated in accordance
with the criteria established in Section 7, Evaluation of Responses.
 
 
Statement of Work Required. Consultant shall create a web app using JavaScript Libraries and HTML5 that performs
the following:
1. Displays a printable calendar containing predefined assignments. Jobs are predefined from a Microsoft
SQL database routine and would populate the calendar. The calendar should be created using jQuery
Full Calendar JavaScript Calendar or equivalent.
2. Allows for jobs contained within the calendar to be assigned to users by clicking on the job.
3. Store users in a Microsoft SQL database.
4. Allows the assessor to have the option to display printable driving directions providing the optimal route
to visit each task within the selected Assessment. The routing routine should use a navigation software
app.

Hi,
 
FYI – for the last 2 days we have had poor ISP service, this morning it was extremely bad.  Fortunately, the ISP provider technician found a bad junction wire at the pole just this morning (I just finished meeting with him), he replaced it and we now seem to have a solid connection and transfer rates.
 
I’m sharing this because if a new meeting time was sent I didn’t get it.  I have read the PP sent to me and I don’t have any questions at this time, I want to present it to Management on {{Day}}/{{Day}} and will use the PP for reference.
 
I propose, all things considered, we re-schedule after I have had a discussion with Management; does that sound good to you?

Would love to learn more and discuss how we can help {{Company_Name}} build projects with our engineering and design teams.

Hi,
 
The meeting was held this morning with the same end result which is ‘hold’; primarily because one customer's implementation schedule was pushed out a quarter due to them having infra challenges.  This buys us a little breathing room but I am impressed with them it is only a short stay and we need to address this both in the intermediate-term and how it can be an option for any future… bottlenecks.
 
I appreciate the check-in, for now, we have to wait and see.",1

This data helps us understand the hopes and fears of your prospects and how best to harness those attitudes to help them become new customers.

2. Plan creation — We take a survey of {{company}}’s current marketing channels to see what is being done now. This helps us understand what steps are being left out and what opportunities are being missed. Next, we analyze marketing channels new to {{company}} to determine the best approach for expanding your market reach. This is followed by tailoring a plan to achieve specific advertising milestones:
to grow every month {{company}}’s number of customers,
to get more engagement from existing customers which will strengthen their commitment to the {{company}} brand, and
to reduce customer churn.

We target double-digit, month-on-month growth in the initial, 90-day test, and an overall 50% reduction in customer churn.

3. Execution — We execute the plan, which always starts with original content creation. The plan includes monitoring and analysis of incremental results, plus daily meetings to review progress. It also includes ads management, engagement metrics, and regular performance review. We update the plan with any required changes to ensure we meet plan goals.

4. Refinement — We make daily, weekly, and monthly adjustments to the plan based on ongoing performance. Such refinements are based on monthly and quarterly customer acquisition, plus CPC and CPM benchmarks and metrics.

Overall goals:
Double-digit, month-on-month growth in new customers,
Grow existing customer engagement by 50%,
Reduce customer churn by 50%, and
Reduce ad cost per new customer acquisition by at least 20%.

"Hi {{Name}}, Thanks for reaching out. To launch and maintain these campaigns is an enormous amount of work. We need to spend the time to...
 
1. Understand your business
2. Think creatively about how to reach customers (invitations to do business derived from problem-solution pairs).
3. Identify creative ways to find leads.
4. Create the campaigns in a way where we have a 360-degree view of the customer (Social, email, phone, chat)
5. Work the pipeline and stay engaged while we help build a relationship with the prospect
6. Ultimately move them along to a close.
 
In addition to the above steps, we have to work with clients on upgrading their collateral and website because those pieces dictate the extent to which we can support them.
 
I understand that you would like to move forward however we cannot do this work without being paid for it. I understand that you want a results-driven team, however, our outreach projects are structured with both components:
 
A.) A monthly stipend to pay the bills and all the above creative work.
B.) A contingency commission that is paid to the sales rep for them to stay motivated.
 
I think you will have a hard time finding a quality team that will execute what you want strictly on a contingency basis.
 
If things change feel free to reach out.

I completely understand your concern regarding the timelines and cost estimates that we have proposed for this project. As far as the proportionality of pricing to the efficiency and quality of work are related, Punch’s expertise will never be questioned from your side, we make sure we deliver within the timelines that have been put forward by our team.
 
Also, as we had a brief intro, I would suggest a detailed discussion of your necessities and extent of work in our next call and that will allow me to revise the cost and timelines more accurately, taking into account the current needs of {{Company}}.
Let’s get on the phone and talk this out further.
 
Best Regards.

"Hi Samantha,
 
Just wanted to quickly send in a quick question: 
 
For the landing page, we have a button that opens up a Calendly invite pop-up to schedule meetings. Currently, we have a dummy account put in place, but could you please send in a (preferably) Calendly invite link to put there for you?
 
Cheers
—------------------------

We don’t use Calendly at the moment.
 
What is the alternative?
—------------------

Would you happen to use any sort of Calendar application to book meetings?
 
HubSpot Calendar, TidyCal, or any of the sort might work.  
 
If you don't have a booking application in place - we could direct the users to your existing 'Contact Us' page on your website. 
 
Let me know and we can go from there.
 
Cheers
—-----------------

Yes we do have HubSpot calendars but we have them for each sales person…

—---------------------
Hi Samantha,
 
Hope you had a good weekend!
 
For the mail campaigns, could you get us the HubSpot calendar links for each sales rep? 
 
We'll set up a separate landing page and link for each sales rep.
 
Cheers
 —---------------------
 
Ok yes sure!
 
South Africa – Tendayi 
Nigeria – Michael 
Argentina and Peru – Veronica 
Brazil – Paulo 
 
When will you be kicking off this initial campaign to the MQL list?
 
—--------------------------

Hey Samantha, just a quick question - in the leads you sent us we have leads from West Africa and East Africa. Which calendar link would you like us to use for each? 
 
We just need to figure out these details and we can send over a file with the appropriate links for you to launch this campaign. 
 
Cheers
—-------------------------
No probs and thanks for checking!
 
East and South are Tendayi
 
West, North and Central are Michael
",1
"Hi {{Name}}, Thanks for reaching out. To launch and maintain these campaigns is an enormous amount of work. We need to spend the time to...
 
1. Understand your business
2. Think creatively about how to reach customers (invitations to do business derived from problem-solution pairs).
3. Identify creative ways to find leads.
4. Create the campaigns in a way where we have a 360-degree view of the customer (Social, email, phone, chat)
5. Work the pipeline and stay engaged while we help build a relationship with the prospect
6. Ultimately move them along to a close.
 
In addition to the above steps, we have to work with clients on upgrading their collateral and website because those pieces dictate the extent to which we can support them.
 
I understand that you would like to move forward however we cannot do this work without being paid for it. I understand that you want a results-driven team, however, our outreach projects are structured with both components:
 
A.) A monthly stipend to pay the bills and all the above creative work.
B.) A contingency commission that is paid to the sales rep for them to stay motivated.
 
I think you will have a hard time finding a quality team that will execute what you want strictly on a contingency basis.
 
If things change feel free to reach out.

I completely understand your concern regarding the timelines and cost estimates that we have proposed for this project. As far as the proportionality of pricing to the efficiency and quality of work are related, Punch’s expertise will never be questioned from your side, we make sure we deliver within the timelines that have been put forward by our team.
 
Also, as we had a brief intro, I would suggest a detailed discussion of your necessities and extent of work in our next call and that will allow me to revise the cost and timelines more accurately, taking into account the current needs of {{Company}}.
Let’s get on the phone and talk this out further.
 
Best Regards.

"Hello {{Name}}, We help companies like {{company}} fill their B2B sales pipelines with highly qualified prospects, increasing revenue. Our B2B growth program includes 4 major steps:
1. Research
2. Demand Generation
3. Meetings/Appointments (relationship building)
4. Closing (revenue generation)
These four steps generate a revenue-building system from scratch. This means that, unlike other companies, we do more than merely set appointments. For instance, our team of researchers gathers live data for prospects who are in the market, right now, for your solution. We do this by accessing 10,000+ job boards, conference listings, and more, building a list of active prospects. From there, our sales team reaches out to these potential customers to set up appointments. Then, we loop in your team to these appointments, including pitch writing, adjustment, analysis, relationship building and finally closing. Once we start working together, we will write the pitches using your collateral, and schedule a kickoff with our sales and research teams to consult with you on constructing the initial lists.

"Hi {{Name}},
 
I found your company on Indeed and wanted to discuss how our ShadowProgram could help ITX Corp increase engineering productivity 2x in a 30-day pilot.
 
Our ShadowProgram pairs our ex-Google verified team of full-stack, back-end, and/or mobile engineers with your engineering team to double current engineering velocity; each of your engineer's ""Shadow"" will enable a 2-fold increase in storyboard tracker points delivered per sprint after the ShadowProgram is initiated within 30-days.
 
We've executed projects for Airware, Cape, PocketGems, Marie Kondo, The League, and over 70+ other companies and startups successfully with our ShadowProgram.
 
Our ShadowProgram often works in one of two ways –
 
1-to-1: Our engineers pair up 1-to-1 with your engineers, so each engineer on your team has a Punch Shadow that's doubling output, your engineer's ""Shadow"" is often working on the same feature or deliverable
 
Team-to-team: We split responsibilities by team, where we take certain features or milestones as well as your team members, and double overall output, often splitting up segments of work
 
I'd like to set up a call to discuss a 30-day pilot of our Shadow program with you, how does your calendar look this week and we can set up a time?

Thanks,
—-------------------
 
Thanks for sending the information.
Apologies, I had a long day of work on Friday and by the end of the day, I had forgotten about sending you the MSA.
Here is the MSA model, the SoW model, and the Contractor Agreement (that the individual contractors would need to sign to be notified of the expectations around non-compete, confidentiality, etc).
—-----------------------
 
Thank you for sending these over. I'll send you the signed copy shortly. 
 
Can you please specify this (screenshot below) as this is a bit confusing
—----------------------
 
As I think we are moving towards an agency contractor ship agreement the above-mentioned screenshot would not be required for us to fill.
 
Thanks,
—-------------------
 
Please find attached the signed copies of the MSA's from our side. We will keep the contractor agreement and get that signed when we start the augmentation process.
 
What does your calendar look like for Thursday or Friday this week to discuss further and start the augmentation process? 
 
Thanks,
—-----------------
 
{{Name}}
Sorry, I cannot see the screenshot you mention.
What I can provide as context, is that we use the same MSA for all types of engagements (C2C, C2H, and Direct Hire). That's why it has the provision of a ""hiring fee"" or a ""conversion fee"". 
It is the SoW that defines what is the engagement type, and in the case of agencies like yours, we would simply do a C2C, with no conversion clause. 
Hope that helps build the right context.
If you are in agreement with the MSA (understanding that it includes some clauses that will not be invoked) I can have our legal counsel send you a link for an electronic signature (with HelloSign).
—-------------------------
 
{{Name}}
Our Legal Counsel sent it on 11/04. And just re-sent e-signature through HelloSign

Got it now! It missed my Inbox. I have signed it from our side.

Hi {{Name}}!
 
It was great to meet you too. 
 
The person you mention, for what position would it be? So we can schedule it.
 
I share the most critical positions that we need to cover:
 
Sr Frontend Developer: {{Link}}
Sr Backend Developer: {{Link}}
System Administrator: {{Link}}
DevOps Engineer: {{Link}}
 
It is mandatory for all positions that candidates have a fluent level of English. Especially for the DevOps position, this point is totally defining since it will have direct contact with the client.
In addition to fluency, we consider that communication skills, in general, are a key point, and so the ability of multi-location and multi-cultural teamwork.
 
Another important point is the possibility of working in the client's time: {{Time}} and for DevOps and SysAdmin the person should be able to cover on-call rotations.
 
If you need any other additional information, do not hesitate to reach out.
 
Thank you!
 
Greetings.

—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.

That's why we started Punch Staffing (see here: http://staffing.punch.cool)– We’ve taken our knowledge/experience and turned it into recruiting the top 1% of talent. Don’t believe it?

Take our 3-candidate in the 24-hour challenge.3-candidates in 24 hours. That's our promise.

"Hi {{Name}}, We help companies like {{company}} boost their B2C visibility, market share and profit through Punch’s B2C growth program. This program consists of a 4-step process:

1. Analysis — We dive deep into ads being run by your top 1 to 3 competitors on Facebook, AdWords, Google+, etc., to understand what they’re doing right and what you could be doing better. We perform analyses on keywords, SEO, website traffic and app store traffic, to see where you may be missing golden opportunities and where you may be losing your visitors. We gather data on,
Who are your customers?
How {{company}} is doing with getting them?
What does it cost to acquire a new customer?

This data helps us understand the hopes and fears of your prospects and how best to harness those attitudes to help them become new customers.

2. Plan creation — We take a survey of {{company}}’s current marketing channels to see what is being done now. This helps us understand what steps are being left out and what opportunities are being missed. Next, we analyze marketing channels new to {{company}} to determine the best approach for expanding your market reach. This is followed by tailoring a plan to achieve specific advertising milestones:
to grow every month {{company}}’s number of customers,
to get more engagement from existing customers which will strengthen their commitment to the {{company}} brand, and
to reduce customer churn.

We target double-digit, month-on-month growth in the initial, 90-day test, and an overall 50% reduction in customer churn.

3. Execution — We execute the plan, which always starts with original content creation. The plan includes monitoring and analysis of incremental results, plus daily meetings to review progress. It also includes ads management, engagement metrics, and regular performance review. We update the plan with any required changes to ensure we meet plan goals.

4. Refinement — We make daily, weekly, and monthly adjustments to the plan based on ongoing performance. Such refinements are based on monthly and quarterly customer acquisition, plus CPC and CPM benchmarks and metrics.

Overall goals:
Double-digit, month-on-month growth in new customers,
Grow existing customer engagement by 50%,
Reduce customer churn by 50%, and
Reduce ad cost per new customer acquisition by at least 20%.

"Hello Simon,
 
I found you on Indeed looking for a Data & Examinations Assistant and wanted to reach out to discuss how we can help with Bridlington School's artificial intelligence/machine learning strategy.
 
We’re an ex-Google-founded engineering team specializing in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) implementations. We’ve worked on both supervised and unsupervised strategies, classification, time-series, quant/financial, and reinforcement learning problems.

We’ve worked with Cape, Dispatchr, 1-Page, Google, and many other companies requiring AI and ML.

I wanted to follow up on my email below about working together on artificial intelligence/machine learning areas.

"We help companies like {{company}} design, develop and engineer products from the ground up. We specialize in Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development so you can tell right away the long-term sustainability of a product concept before investing more time and money in creating all possible features. This significantly reduces your long-term risk.

Our MVP program follows 4 key Concept-to-Reality steps:

Brainstorming — We define the product using SWOT analysis, revenue model validation, product differentiation from competitors, and key feature definition.

Prioritizing — We define the feature timeline by shortlisting those features with maximum benefits, defining the minimum viable product, and by removing non-critical features from the pipeline.

Developing — We take the MVP project from concept to code by including QA, project management, a seasoned coding team, daily coding, creation of the minimum viable product, bi-weekly release cycle, continuous improvement, and weekly meetings to review product progress.

Scaling — We build the future, today, by preparing for mass commercialization, by planning out versions 2?5 features, and by identifying new sources of capital and growth.

Check out: http://www.punch.cool/services/engineering/

We would love to set up a call to discuss your concept, and to answer a few key questions. From this, we will return our complete analysis and proposed MVP timeline.

When do you have about 15 minutes to chat?

"Hi {{Name}}, We help start-ups and established companies like {{Company}} acquire a unique and compelling brand image that will represent {{Company}} in the market place. In the first week, we take in all the information you have that will guide us in achieving the desired image. That includes: existing mock-ups, user stories, interaction flows, previous design work, and designs, samples, or brands that you like. This is followed by a phone coversation to discuss how you envision your story being told. Then, we will create initial design mock-ups for your review. By discussing these mock-ups, we will have a better idea of the brand image you want. We will repeat the process of design, review, and discussion until we achieve the look and feel that you love. After this, we will use the finalized design as a baseline to tell the rest of the story, in the UIUX, in the design of the products, and in the overall customer-facing, company presence. The end results will be the brand image that {{Company}} will be proud to display and which will communicate the propoer tone not only to the targeted market segment but also to the world at large.

If of interest, let me know and we can discuss it further?

"I know this is a difficult time for all of us. With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year. To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed. Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as {{Company}} employees to share the spirit of the season. Other felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances. After weighing these point of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the {{Company}}'s holiday party that was scheduled for {{Day}. Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for {{Company}} to incur the expense of such an event. I regret that this action is necessary because i recognize that your hard work throughout this year merits a holiday celebration and so much more. We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into holiday season.   ",0
